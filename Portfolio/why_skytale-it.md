The name "Skytale" holds significant meaning for me:
*   A **Skytale is an ancient Greek tool** used for a transposition cipher, specifically by the Spartans for secure military communications. It consisted of a cylinder with a strip of parchment wound around it, on which a message was written. This method ensured **clarity, precision, and secure communication**.
*   The ".it" in the domain refers to **Italy**, my country of origin.
*   "IT" also stands for **Information Technology**, a field I have studied and worked in for many years. My professional background as a Product Manager/Owner has a strong foundation in IT, including experience in network operations, security, and continuous improvement strategies.

For me, `Skytale` **symbolizes clarity, precision, and secure communication** â€“ values that I strive to embody throughout my professional journey. It reflects my dedication to not only understanding new technologies and security but also to ensuring that information is conveyed effectively and securely in all my projects.
